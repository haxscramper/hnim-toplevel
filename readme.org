This repository mostly contains toplevel meta configuration & files
that are used to create environment for various projects.

* Documentation

* Running tests

Most nimble files in projects implement several additional tasks for
testing using docker:

- ~dockertestDevel~ - Run tests in docker container but with WIP
  versions of locall packages. If I'm working on something and want to
  test if it will work in clean environment but with *my local edits
  to dependencies* I use it.
- ~dockertest~ - Clean test run in docker container
- ~installTest~ - Test installation from the repository
- ~testall~ - run test suite on devel & stable nim compiler + test
  installation.

To create docker image for tests run ~make nim-base~ - it will
generate correctly named debian-based image with all necessary
packages & nim tools installed.

* Toplevel

Toplevel nimble file implements several maintenance tasks for
generating & comitting documentation changes, runnning tests etc.

- ~statall~ print git statistics for all subdirectories
- ~pushall~ push all commited changs to all repositories
- ~testall~ run test for all subdirectories
- ~docall~ generate documentation for all modules
- ~commitdocs~ commit documentation changes
